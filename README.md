# EventSphere Management System

## Background
EventSphere Management is a leading event management firm specializing in organizing
large-scale expos and trade shows across multiple industries. Traditional expo management

platform that streamlines operations for organizers, exhibitors, and attendees, ensuring a
smooth, efficient, and engaging expo experience.
